Introduction
------------
This program written in Python 3.6 allows the users to play the "Hangman" game, 
in a console or with a Tk graphical interface.


Presentation
------------
According to the sheet, the goal of the game is to guess a word, while your character on the screen is not
hung yet. 

For part 2, the non graphical game, we respected all the specifications:
- The user has to guess a random word, one letter at a time.
- The guess is not counted as one if the letter has already been guessed.
- If the letter is in the word, we show them in the placeholder word, instead of a "_".
- If the letter is not in the word, the user is warned that he was wrong, he loses a try, 
and his character gets closer to death...
- The user is able to choose between a male and female character.
- The user is asked if he wants to play again at the end of a round.

To do so, we used decided to use some functions.

For part 3, we created a GUI using Tkinter. We used a more event driven way of programming.
