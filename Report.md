Introduction
------------
This program written in Python 3.6 allows the users to play the "Hangman" game, 
in a console or with a Tk graphical interface.


Presentation
------------
According to the sheet, the goal of the game is to guess a word, while your character on the screen is not
hung yet. 

For part 2, the non graphical game, we respected all the specifications:
- The user has to guess a random word, one letter at a time.
- The guess is not counted as one if the letter has already been guessed.
- If the letter is in the word, we show them in the placeholder word, instead of a "_".
- If the letter is not in the word, the user is warned that he was wrong, he loses a try, 
and his character gets closer to death...
- The user is able to choose between a male and female character.
- The user is asked if he wants to play again at the end of a round.

To do so, we used decided to use some functions.

For part 3, we created a GUI using Tkinter. We used a more event driven way of programming.


The different algorithms
------------------------

###Part 1
####3

3. a)    


     l = ["Salut", "les", "amis", "Anticonstitutionnellement"]
     
     for w in l:
     print(w[1:-1])
     
For this program we just print the different words from the second letter to the penultimate on after the other with a for loop.

3. b)

    
    l = ["Salut", "les", "amis", "Anticonstitutionnellement"]
    max_length = 0
    pos = 0
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if len(l[i]) > max_length:
            max_length = len(l[i])
            pos = i
    
    print(f"Longest word is \"{l[pos]}\" at index {pos}.")

For this one we are classing the lenth of the differents words by comparing thoses
to do so wwe're using an if in a for loop.

3. c)


    l = ["amelie", "g√©rad", "parc zoologique", "zoo"]
    
    l.sort()
    
    print(l[-1])
    
For this program we're sorting the array by usinge the function sort, the we're showing the last
string  in the array.

3. d) 


    l = ["Salut", "les", "amis", "Anticonstitutionnellement"]
    l2 = []
    
    for w in l:
        l2.append(len(w))
    
    print(l)
    print(l2)
    
    
In this program we're adding the length of all the word in a second array by using a for loop.

3. e)

     
    l = ["Salut", "les", "amis", "Anticonstitutionnellement"]
    print(f"They are {len(l)} elements in the list :")
    for w in l:
        print(w)
        
In this one we're using the print (f ) to get the length of the array in the print, then we're printing all the array
by using a for loop.

3. f)


    l = ["Salut", "les", "amis", "Anticonstitutionnellement", "salut", "salutations", "sAlUT"]
    
    word_to_delete = "SALUT"
    offset = 0
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        w = l[i + offset]
        if word_to_delete.lower() == w.lower():
            l.pop(i + offset)
            offset -= 1
    
    print(l)
    
    
For this program we're defining the word to delete then we've created a for loop of the length of the array and we're 
doing an if to check in a lower version of the words and if it's same word we're deleting it.


    
1. g)


3. h)


    l = ["Salut", "les", "$w_1$", "Anticonstitutionnellement", "SALUT"]
    l2 = []
    
    word = input("Enter your word? ")
    
    for i in range(len(l)):
        w = l[i]
        if word.lower() == w.lower():
            l2.append(i)
    
    print(f"They are {len(l2)} occurences of {word} at index : {l2}")
    
    
For this program we're defining the word that we need to check the number of occurrence so we've created a for loop of 
the length of the array and we're doing an if to check in a lower version of the words and if it's same word we're adding
one to the number of occurrences.

4. a)


    with open("list.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as rawfile:
        text = rawfile.read()
        words = text.split()
        text = text.replace('\n', '').replace('\r', '')
        char = len(text.replace('\n', '').replace('\r', ''))
        print(f"Number of words : {len(words)}\n"
              f"Number of characters : {len(text)}")
              
In this program we're using the with statement close the file properly, then we read the text. We're using the function
split to get the number of words and we replace the enters and spaces to get the number of characters whit the len() function.


4. b)


    with open("list.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as rawfile:
        text = rawfile.read()
        words = text.split()
        words_set = sorted(set(words))
        for w in words_set:
            print(f"{words.count(w)} {w}")
            
In this program we're using the with statement close the file properly, then we read the text. We're using the function
split to get all words and we sort the words. Finally in the for loop that is doing all the different
words of the list we put a print (f ) which has the function count to get the number of occurrences.


4. c)


    with open("list.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as rawfile:
        text = rawfile.read()
        text = text.upper()
        print(text)
    
        with open("list_upper.txt","w",encoding="utf-8") as rawfile_upper:
            rawfile_upper.write(text)
            
For this program we're using the with statement close the file properly, then we read the text. Then we're using the 
function upper. Finally we write the text again but in uppercase.


4. d)


    with open("list.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as rawfile:
        text = rawfile.read()
        words = text.split()
        w1 = input("w1? ")
    
        for w2 in words:
            if w1.lower() in w2.lower():
                print(f"{w2}")
                
For this program we're using the with statement close the file properly, then we read the text. Then we're using the 
function lower Then w're using the function lower. Finally we use the in to find if the word w1 is in w2.


4. e)


    import random

    with open("list.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as rawfile:
        text = rawfile.read()
        words = text.split()

    print(words[random.randint(0, len(words)-1)])
    

For this one we import the random class, then we're using the with statement close the file properly, then we read the text.
Finally we print a random word by choosing a random int in the length of the number of words.


4. f)


    import random
    
    with open("list.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as rawfile:
        text = rawfile.read()
        words = text.split()
    
        w1 = words[random.randint(0, len(words) - 1)]
    
        l = input("Choose a letter: ")
    
        w2 = ""
    
        if l in w1:
            for i in range(len(w1)):
                if w1[i] == l:
                    w2 += l
                else:
                    w2 += "_"
    
            print(w2)
            
For this one we import the random class, then we're using the with statement close the file properly, then we read the text.
Then we choose a random word by choosing a random int in the length of the number of words.We input a str. Finally we create a w2 then 
we use a if to see if a letter is in the word and if it is, we print the word with "_" at the place of other letters.
